# Development

  * Use the commit guidelines in https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary
  * Name your development branches something like `feat/<feature>`. The prefix follows the same general idea as the conventional commit prefix.
  * Try to respect our coding guidelines. Our eslint configuration should help here.
  * Include a changeset for your changes. Run `pnpm changeset` at the root of the repository for this.
